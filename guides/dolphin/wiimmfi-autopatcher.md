title: "Wiimmfi Auto Patcher on Dolphin Emulator"
---

The Wiimmfi Auto patcher is an application that applies runtime patches to the game inserted to the disc drive. <br>
This is particularly nice on Dolphin because:
- You don't have to use twice the amount of space for a Wiimmfi-patched copy
- It's fast

However, you're still going to need _your_ NAND backup.

### Requirements
* Dolphin Emulator
* The game to patch with Wiimmfi
* [Wiimmfi Auto Patcher](https://oscwii.org/library/app/wiimmfipatcher)
