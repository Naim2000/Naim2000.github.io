# Installing Priiloader on Dolphin Emulator

This guide will show you how to set up Priiloader on Dolphin Emulator. I'm assuming you already [installed the Homebrew Channel](/guides/dolphin-hbc).

## Installing Priiloader

1. Download the [Priiloader installer zip](https://oscwii.org/library/app/priiloader) from here.
  * Pre-releases can be found [here](https://github.com/DacoTaco/priiloader/releases).
1. Extract the Priiloader zip to the `WiiSDSync` folder.
1. Launch the Homebrew Channel, then launch the Priiloader installer.
1. Give it a few seconds to prepare, then press `+` to install.
1. Once the installer finishes, stop the emulation. (Return to loader doesn't want to work ??)
1. Launch the Wii system menu and the Homebrew Channel again.
1. Press the `HOME` button, select `Exit to System menu`.

The Priiloader menu should  open. Congrats.

## System menu hacks

Because of Priiloader's nature of loading before the System menu, it also has the advantage of applying patches to it. Not a lot of these may be particularly useful on Dolphin however. So here's some that you may find somewhat useful.

+ `Auto-Press A at Health Screen`: Up to you. I prefer the one below it though.
+ `Replace Health Screen with Backmenu`: This might be a little bit faster than the health screen??? Since press A shows up after everything is all loaded
+ `Move Disc channel`: 😎
+ `Wiimmfi Patch v4`: Basically for nostalgia purposes. This allows for discs launched through the Disc channel to be patched with Wiimmfi.
+ `Region Free EVERYTHING`: You can just launch stuff through Dolphin directly. However this does help stop region mishaps from happening
+ `No System Menu Background Music`: Maybe you're playing your own.
+ `Re-enable Bannerbomb v2`: For comedic purposes. It also actually works which is pretty cool.
